**DevOps Capstone Project**

**Part 1: Application and Container Building**

The client folder contains code for the frontend (Note: I do not know any FE tool so implementing it in python script ðŸ˜„)

The server folder contains code for the backend

docker-compose.yml builds images for both frontend and backend by using custom Dockerfile for each.
